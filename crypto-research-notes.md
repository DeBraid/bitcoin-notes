# Random Notes on Crypto 

## Ethereum: customized, user-created blockchains

From [ethereum][1] white paper: underlying blockchain technology as a tool of distributed consensus is the other major breakthrough provided by bitcoin.

> Ethereum: provide a blockchain with a built-in programming language that can be used to create "contracts".

Broad categories of such alternative blockchain applications include: 

* coloured coins
* smart property
* smart contracts

These contracts encode arbitrary state transition functions, allowing *users to create* any of the systems listed above, and others not yet imagined, simply by writing the business logic in a few lines of code.

## History

In the 1980's and 90's anonymous e-cash protocols were created but failed to gain traction as they relied on central intermediary. 

1988 Wei Dai proposed b-money, the first to propose creating money through computational puzzles + decentralized consensus.  

In 2005 Hal Finney introduced RPOWs, 'reusable proofs-of-work' which combined elements of b-money with Adam Back (of Blockstream.io) Hashcash, but again fell short of long-run success due to the reliance on central authority (trusted computing as backend).

In 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto successfully created and built a public-key cryptography

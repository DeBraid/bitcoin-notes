## Ethereum: customized, user-created blockchains

From [ethereum][1] white paper: underlying blockchain technology as a tool of distributed consensus is the other major breakthrough provided by bitcoin.

> Ethereum: provide a blockchain with a built-in programming language that can be used to create "contracts".

Broad categories of such alternative blockchain applications include: 

* coloured coins
* smart property
* smart contracts

These contracts encode arbitrary state transition functions, allowing *users to create* any of the systems listed above, and others not yet imagined, simply by writing the business logic in a few lines of code.

## History

#### 1970s

Public key cryptography changed dramatically in early 1970s, when Bailey Diffie and Martin Hellman developed the fundamental ideas of dual-key, aka public key, cryptography. 

They published their results in 1976â€”solving one of the fundamental problems of cryptography: key distribution.  The consequences were profound as they essentially broke a monopoly held by government entities on cryptographic technology.

Diffie-Hellman key-exchange paper allowed every company, every citizen the sorts of crypto that not many years prior ranked alongside the atomic bomb as a source of government/NSA power.

#### 1980s and 1990s

Anonymous e-cash protocols were created but failed to gain traction as they relied on central intermediary. 

1988 Wei Dai proposed b-money, the first to propose creating money through computational puzzles + decentralized consensus.  

#### 2000s

In 2005 Hal Finney introduced RPOWs, 'reusable proofs-of-work' which combined elements of b-money with Adam Back (of Blockstream.io) Hashcash, but again fell short of long-run success due to the reliance on central authority (trusted computing as backend).

In 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto successfully created and built a public-key cryptography

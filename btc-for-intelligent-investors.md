Much of this is taken from the paper, it is highly opinionated.  Consider this an annotated version of the white paper. 

## Abstract 

Electronic cash for online payments is possible without financial institutions.  

Digital signatures combined with a peer-to-peer network provides a novel solution to a 40+ year old problem in computer science. A network of transactions forms chain --  the *blockchain* -- which is maintained such that the longest chain with the most consensus (CPU power) is the de facto account balance, or in bitcoin language the *ledger*. 

> The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, 
> but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power.

The network is incentives to work hard to earn BTC (and thus invest CPU power), since the quality and security of the distributed ledger is directly proprotional to their particpation in the mining (provision of marginal CPU power);


#### 51% Attack 

>As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers.

First, this is the major assumption in the abstract!  So a vital point for bitcoin.  Second, what an awful sentence!  The downside of secrecy is that the editing process is absent.  How about: 

If the network is sufficiently diverse, then it is safe from malicious attackers.  The cost to hi-jack the network would in theory exceed the value of the coins.  CPU power remains distributed 

>The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.

The trust, is that is you aren't actively mining (and thus making some marginal attempt at verifying the blockchain independently), then you can re-join and take the blockchain provided as gospel. 


## Introduction 

Banks and FI's are the pillars of modern financial system.  The element of trust required to transact in the modern economy is a major drawback of the current system.

This trust is costly in many ways.  The entirety of credit card, AML and fraud prevention for banks is $50-100 billion per year conservatively.  This is the 'vig'
 upon which FI's collect or acting as trusted third-party to financial transactions. 

However, with the advent of bitcoin, the requirement for third parties can be wholly, or at worst significantly, eliminated.

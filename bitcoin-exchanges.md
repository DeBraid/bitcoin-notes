# Purpose of third parties in Bitcoin 

Paradox of BTC is that while peer-to-peer network maintains the ledger, many tools build to use the blockchain are third parties.  Whats up with that?
-----------------
## Don't the Bitcoin exchanges control the market and price? 
-- Buyers and sellers of btc/fiat set the price via their individual desire to buy/sell. 

## What Do Exchanges Do
Exchanges (EX) simply provide a forum for connecting buyers and sellers, a convenience function.  EX value prop is convenience-based since they exist to replace/augment that secure process of storing private keys offline, which may not be easy/simple/convenient.  

EX offer value primarily to features/limitations in the BTC protocol (naming the time-scale requirement to get assurance against double-spends (aka it takes at least 10mins, and more comfortably 50mins to get confirmation that transaction is OK/safe).  

The *counter* really simple: if generating your private keys offline and printing for cold storage is 'too much work' to secure you money, then you should probably stick with banks and continue to pay whatever fees they see fit. 

> Bitcoin is not for everyone and it's capacity to go  
> mainstream (adoption rates) is limited by  
> perceived quality of ones existing financial services.  

## Without them how would Bitcoin be of any value other than people to hold money privately offline. 

Ex. the stock market is public so if money is stolen from it, when that happens the entire user community (shareholders)?  When a Bitcoin exchange is hacked the overall value of Bitcoin drops, the money you're holding securely offline is now de-valued.
-- Brokers/custodians/banks/etc ("third-parties") hold or transfer assets (stocks, bonds, futures, options, derivatives).  They charge fees for these services, which range widely.  They secure the transaction, and their services will likely remain widely available for citizens in developed countries.   

Harm done to/or by an individual firm / financial institution is usually isolated.  The currency (or financial instrument) is less a factor.  People didn't stop trading stocks because Bernie Madoff, nor did they get rid of leveraged loans and exotic credit products following the Great Financial Crisis. Blame typically lies on the shoulders of individuals within a firm, and their incompetence or lack of oversight from fellow employees/bosses. 

The breakthrough feature -- that confers much of the value of bitcoin -- is that its a protocol maintaining globally distributed ledger.  This 'ledger' or the *blockchain*, acts as source of truth, such that the REQUIREMENT for trusted third parties is absent.  Moreover, the integrity of the blockchain is not in question with most recent instance of hot wallet hack (bitstamp $5 million or 19k bitcoin; Jan 2015).

This does not preclude service providers from acting as third party (wallets, exchanges, etc) offering / implementing apps and layers on top of the blockchain.

Like with stocks there is a trade off between effort and cost.  Stock trading with an old-school broker/advisor costs 2-5%, vs. roboadvisors or brokerage accounts (0.5-1%).  Costs incurred are a function of personal labour in every financial market, it's just hard to spot.

## Don't the Bitcoin exchanges control the market and price? 
-- Buyers and sellers of btc/fiat set the price via their individual desire to buy/sell. 

Exchanges (EX) simply provide a forum for connecting buyers and sellers, a convenience function.  EX value prop is convenience-based since they exist to replace/augment that secure process of storing private keys offline, which may not be easy/simple/convenient.  

EX offer value primarily to features/limitations in the BTC protocol (naming the time-scale requirement to get assurance against double-spends (aka it takes at least 10mins, and more comfortably 50mins to get confirmation that transaction is OK/safe).  

The counter to this is really simply: if generating your private keys offline and printing for cold storage is 'too much work' to secure you money, then you should probably stick with banks and continue to pay whatever fees they see fit. Bitcoin def not for everyone and it's capacity to go mainstream (adoption rates) are limited by the perceived quality of ones existing financial services.  


## Without them how would Bitcoin be of any value other than people to hold money privately offline. 

### ie the stock market is public so it's acceptable if money is stolen from it, when that happens the entire user community (shareholders)? When a Bitcoin exchange is hacked the overall value of Bitcoin drops, the money you're holding securely offline is now de-valued.
-- Brokers/custodians/banks/etc ("third-parties") hold or transfer assets (stocks, bonds, futures, options, derivatives).  They charge fees for these services, which range widely. 

The breakthrough feature -- that confers much of the value of bitcoin -- is that its a protocol maintaining globally distributed ledger.  This 'ledger' or the blockchain, acts as source of truth, such that the REQUIREMENT for trusted third parties is absent.

This does not preclude service providers from acting as third party (wallets, exchanges, etc) offering / implementing apps and layers on top of the blockchain.

Like with stocks there is a trade off between effort and cost.  Stock trading with an old-school broker/advisor costs 2-5%, vs. roboadvisors or brokerage accounts (0.5-1%).  Costs incurred are a function of personal labour in every financial market, it's just hard to spot.

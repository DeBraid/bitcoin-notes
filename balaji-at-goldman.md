# Evolution of Bitcoin
## hosted by Goldman Sachs, video [link here][1].

Bitcoin is payments as packets.  Not paper-based money, packet-based money. A natural fit for the internet.

Bitcoin as a protocol is why we compare its potential scale to the internet in terms of its impact.

Before btc, telco's intermediated sending/receiving packets.  Barriers to entry for information transfer were/are very high.  Bitcoin removes those barriers by enabling peer to peer.

Banks were required to transfer value, but not any node that can connect to the internet can transfer value.  Anything of value can be transfered.  Keys, money, info.

Bitcoin wallets work like email.
